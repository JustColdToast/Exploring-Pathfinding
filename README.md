# Exploring-Pathfinding
This is the start of a program that I intend to use to explore pathfinding algorithms.

I am using Pyglet to provide an interface. The object is for the player circle to move to a target placed anywhere on the screen (with right-click), while avoiding all walls (placed with left click).
